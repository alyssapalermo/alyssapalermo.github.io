  <p>I am very interested in learning about neuroscience, genetics, biochemistry, and how computers are incorporated in those fields for greater efficiency.  
    I also love to exercise! I play volleyball for my high school team and played club volleyball for three years before quitting to focus on academics this year. 
    I also weight lift three times a week and mountain bike for the NICA North Wake Trailhawks.  Outside of exercise I volunteer regularly and have recently started a club at my school called Magic of Science.</p>
